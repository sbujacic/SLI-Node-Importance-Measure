# SLI-Node-Importance-Measure
We introduce Semi-Local Intregation (SLI) measure, a node centrality measure for undirected and weighted graphs that takes into account the coherence of the locally connected subnetwork and evaluates the integration of nodes within their neighbourhood. 

If you use the introduced Semi-Local Integration Measure, we kindly ask you to cite our article Semi-Local Integration Measure of Node Importance,
